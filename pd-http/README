Introduction
------------

This package provides a way of using HTTP to share multi-user data in Pure Data
patches.

Install
-------

Make sure you have memcache installed on your server, and python-memcache. Put
keyvalue.cgi and incrdecr.cgi into your cgi-bin directory.

On your client make sure you have wget installed and pdsend and pdreceive are
in your path. Load up the example patch http-help.pd and then execute the
fetchurl script on the command line.

keyvalue.cgi
------------

Takes a Pd list as a query string and returns a Pd list as a string. The first
atom of the Pd list should be the key name. If you only supply a key name it
does a lookup. If you supply a full list, it will set the key (first item of
the list) to be equal to the rest of the list.

Example usage with URL followed by response from the server:

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/keyvalue.cgi>
keyvalue no-key;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/keyvalue.cgi?hello this is my message>
keyvalue set hello this is my message;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/keyvalue.cgi?hello>
this is my message;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/keyvalue.cgi?fewafeaw>
;

incrdecr.cgi
------------

Does remote atomic increment-decrement for values from Pure Data.
Usage as URL and return value below:

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi>
incrdecr no-key;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi?non-existent-key>
incrdecr no-such-key;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi?mykey one two many>
incrdecr too-many-args;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi?mykey incr>
16;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi?mykey decr>
15;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi?mykey 15>
15;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi?mykey>
15;

<http://mccormick.cx/cgi-bin/incrdecr.cgi?my-very-bad non-integer>
incrdecr bad-argument;
